        Canadian universities should consider making SAT/ACT scores mandatory for undergraduate 
        admissions to foster merit-based selection, enhance academic competitiveness, and position 
        Canada as a global leader in innovation and entrepreneurship.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Standardized Testing Matters</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In Canada, most universities currently do not require SAT or ACT scores for domestic 
        applicants. While holistic admissions and provincial curricula offer valuable insights into student 
        performance, the absence of a national standardized benchmark can lead to inconsistencies in 
        evaluating academic readiness across provinces and schools.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Introducing mandatory SAT/ACT scores would:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 ml-4">
        <li>Establish a uniform academic metric across provinces and school boards.</li>
        <li>Level the playing field for students from diverse educational backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Reduce grade inflation bias, offering a more objective measure of student capability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Driving Student Motivation and Academic Rigor</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Standardized testing encourages students to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 ml-4">
        <li>Aim higher academically, knowing their performance will be compared nationally.</li>
        <li>Prepare strategically, developing time management, problem-solving, and analytical skills.</li>
        <li>Engage in broader learning, as SAT/ACT content often includes topics beyond provincial 
        curricula.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        This shift would cultivate a culture of academic excellence and resilience, preparing students 
        for the rigors of postsecondary education and global competition.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Enhancing Canada&apos;s Global Competitiveness</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Countries like the United States, South Korea, and India use standardized tests to identify top 
        talent and fuel innovation. By aligning with this model, Canada can:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 ml-4">
        <li>Attract high-performing students, both domestically and internationally.</li>
        <li>Strengthen its academic reputation, making Canadian degrees more globally recognized.</li>
        <li>Foster innovation and entrepreneurship, by admitting students with strong analytical and 
        quantitative skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Rather than being known primarily for natural resources, Canada could evolve into a 
        knowledge-driven economy, powered by a generation of ambitious, well-prepared graduates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Building Engaging and Diverse Classrooms</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Mandatory SAT/ACT scores would help universities:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 ml-4">
        <li>Select students based on merit, not just local grading systems.</li>
        <li>Create intellectually stimulating environments, where students challenge and inspire 
        each other.</li>
        <li>Support equity, by offering merit-based scholarships tied to standardized scores.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        This would lead to healthier classroom dynamics, with motivated learners driving deeper 
        discussions and collaborative problem-solving.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        While standardized testing is not without criticism—concerns about access, stress, and 
        socioeconomic bias must be addressed—Canada has the opportunity to design a fair, inclusive 
        system that uses SAT/ACT scores as one of several tools to assess merit. By doing so, 
        Canadian universities can elevate their admissions standards, empower students, and help 
        shape a future where Canada leads not just in resources, but in ideas.
